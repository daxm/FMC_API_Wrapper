# FMC_API_Wrapper
# Synopsis
A python package and sample user scripting files to help Cisco Security engineers have a better interaction with the Cisco FMC API.

# Important Note (AKA disclaimer)
These scripts don't work yet!!!  We are refactoring the code from a "flat file" style to a python package... assuming we can figure out how to make that work.
