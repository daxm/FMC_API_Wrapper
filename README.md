# FMC_API_Wrapper
# DO NOT download these scripts thinking that they will work in their current state.

## Synopsis
A python package and sample user scripting files to help Cisco Security engineers have a better interaction with the Cisco FMC API.

## Important Note (AKA disclaimer)
These scripts don't work yet!!!  We are refactoring the code from a "flat file" style to a python package... assuming we can figure out how to make that work.
